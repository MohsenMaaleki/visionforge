VisionForge is an AI-powered visual storytelling tool that solves the biggest problem in AI art: character consistency.

**The Problem:**
AI image generators create stunning artwork, but characters look completely different in every image. This makes creating comics, manga, or visual novels nearly impossible.

**The Solution:**
VisionForge extracts "Character DNA" - a structured JSON profile containing every visual detail of your character. This DNA is then injected into every scene generation, ensuring perfect consistency.

**How It Works:**
1. Write your story with character descriptions
2. Choose a visual style (Anime, Realistic, Sci-Fi, Fantasy)
3. Click "Forge Vision"
4. The system generates character portraits and extracts DNA
5. Scenes are generated with consistent characters throughout
6. Export as Manga (B&W) or Manhwa (Color)

**Tech Stack:**
- FIBO by Bria AI for image generation
- Gemini 2.0 Flash for story parsing and DNA extraction
- Reflex (Python) for the web interface

**Why FIBO?**
FIBO's JSON-native architecture is perfect for Character DNA. We pass structured visual attributes directly to the model, achieving unprecedented consistency.

One character. Infinite scenes. That's VisionForge.
